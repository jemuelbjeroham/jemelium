Steps in the Script:
AC1 - Fetch hostgroup agents:
The get_hostgroup_agents() function runs the hg_aglist script to fetch the list of all agents in the host group.

AC2 - Validate host groups:
The validate_and_cleanup() function checks the output against the predefined valid hosts.

AC3 - Use predefined host list for validation:
A list of predefined hosts is provided in the script (predefined_hosts).

AC4 - Output file for errors (if any):
The script logs invalid hosts directly in the console, which can be redirected to a file when scheduled.

AC5 - Remove invalid hosts:
The remove_host() function uses the CLI API command (ctm config server:hostgroup:agent::delete) to remove invalid hosts.

AC6 - Generate summary:
The script outputs a summary:

If the host group is fine: "No host is added. Host group TALONBATCH is good."
If hosts were removed: "Removed invalid host: <hostname> from host group TALONBATCH."
How to Use the Script:
Save this script as a .py file (e.g., validate_talonbatch.py).
Update the predefined hosts and script path as per your environment.
Schedule it in Control-M as a job.
Redirect the script's output to a file if you want logs (e.g., python validate_talonbatch.py > output.log 2>&1).
